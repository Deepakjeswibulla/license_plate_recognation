# 🚗 License Plate Detection & Recognition (Web App)

A **real-time License Plate Detection and Recognition system** built using **Streamlit**, **YOLO**, and **OCR**.
The application supports **live webcam feed** and **uploaded video files**, detects **only license plates**, highlights **high-confidence detections**, and displays recognized plate numbers in a **live-updating table alongside the video**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🎥 Live **Webcam License Plate Detection**
* 📁 **Upload Video & Detect While Playing**
* 🎯 **License Plate–Only Detection** (No vehicle detection)
* 🔲 **Bounding Boxes for High-Confidence Plates Only**
* 🔤 **Improved OCR Accuracy**

  * Uppercase output
  * Reduced duplicate text
* 📊 **Real-Time Detection Table**

  * License plate number
  * Confidence score
* ⚡ Real-time processing
* 🎨 Simple and clean UI

## 🧠 Model Used

### License Plate Detection Model

* YOLO-based custom license plate detector
* Format: `.pt`
* File: `license_plate.pt`
* Included directly in the repository
* Detects **only license plates**

## 🖥️ How the App Works

### Webcam Mode

1. Select **Webcam**
2. Allow camera access
3. License plates are detected in real time
4. Detected plates appear instantly in the table

### Video Upload Mode

1. Upload a video file
2. Video starts playing immediately
3. License plates are detected while the video plays
4. Results update live in the table

## 📊 Detection Table Details

| Column       | Description                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Plate Number | OCR-recognized license plate text |
| Confidence   | Detection confidence score        |

Only **high-confidence detections** are shown and highlighted in the video.

## 🔧 OCR Processing Notes

* OCR output is converted to **UPPERCASE**
* Repeated detections are filtered
* Low-confidence OCR results are ignored

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

* Traffic monitoring systems
* Parking management
* Toll booth automation
* Smart city applications
* Academic and research projects
